# LinkedIn Post Drafts

Here are three options tailored for LinkedIn. The tone is more "business-professional" than Hacker News, focusing on ROI, tough problems, and video.

**Goal:** Attract clinic owners (Dentists, Medical Directors) and tech recruiters/partners.
**Strategy:** Use video if possible (LinkedIn algorithm loves native video), tag relevant technologies, and focus on the "relatable pain" of running a clinic.

## Option 1: The "Business Transformation" Story (Recommended)
*Best for: Directly targeting clinic owners who are tired of missed calls.*

**Headline:** Stop losing patients to voicemail.

**Body:**
I recently built a custom AI Voice Agent designed for dental clinics like Modera Dental here in Miami. The problem? Front desks are swamped, and missed calls mean missed appointments (and revenue).

Unlike standard "press 1" phone trees, this AI prototype:
✅ Answers instantly, 24/7
✅ Actually checks the calendar to book real appointments
✅ Handles rescheduling and cancellations
✅ Transfers complex cases to human staff smoothly

I built this using **Python**, **LiveKit**, and **Google Gemini** to ensure low-latency, natural conversations. The best part? It doesn't sound like a robot reading a script—it interrupts naturally and handles "umms" and corrections.

If you run a clinic and want to automate 80% of your phone traffic, let's chat. I'm looking for a partner to pilot this in a real office.

## Option 2: The "Technical Showcase" (For Credibility)
*Best for: Showing off your engineering skills to recruiters or technical partners.*

**Headline:** Building a persistent, real-time voice agent with Python. 📞🤖

**Body:**
Voice AI is more than just connecting an STT to an LLM. It's about latency, interruption handling, and state management.

I just built a production-ready voice agent demo for a dental office using:
🔹 **Orchestration:** LiveKit Agents (Python)
🔹 **LLM:** Google Gemini Flash
🔹 **Visuals:** Real-time audio visualization (see video)
🔹 **Telephony:** Twilio SIP Trunking

The biggest challenge? Handling the awkward silence. I tuned the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to allow for natural pauses without the bot jumping in too early, while still keeping response times under 500ms.

Check out the demo below where it handles a full appointment booking flow, including database lookups!

## Option 3: The Short & Punchy "Video First" Post
*Best for: High engagement if you have a great demo video.*

**Headline:** This is what the future of dental reception looks like.

**Body:**
*(Video of the agent handling a complex reschedule or angry patient calmly)*

👆 Sound on!

This AI agent demo shows how clinics can handle hundreds of calls a week. It doesn't get tired, it doesn't put you on hold, and it speaks perfect English and Spanish(optional).

Built with **LiveKit** and **Deepgram**. 

DM me if your business is interested in piloting this technology.
